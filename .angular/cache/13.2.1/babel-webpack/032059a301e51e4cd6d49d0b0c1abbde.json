Always a fierce competitor, she was an athlete and honor roll student in high school and earned degrees in psychology and nursing in college. When she began acting, many filmmakers discovered that her talents were being underutilized. Sheri was asked to help produce, cast, and pull together entire films. She's worked on productions as assistant director, script supervisor and production manager. Armed with her knowledge of filmmaking, from the seed of an idea through distribution, Sheri directed her first short film in 2017 titled, Hair of the Dog, which won several awards. She just completed directing the comedic short film 970 Square Feet. Next, Sheri is starting pre-production on Amber Alert which will be the first installment to her anthology. Sheri has also made a name for herself in the independent film world, as a very versatile actor who is not afraid to take on any role, as evidenced by her role as Karma Blake in the award-winning, and controversial short film Snake With A Human Tail, which earned her the title of a \\\"Scream Queen\\\" and established a horror genre fan base. Sheri can be seen in other movies such as Blind, Fall of Grace, Till Death, Lake of Shadows, Vengeance Girl, Violence on Demand, Bearry, Cold Blooded Killers, It Wants Blood!, the Alien Danger! film series and the short film, The Lightning Man. Sheri has also received Best Actress Nominations and won 2 Best Actress Awards.

He starred as Mufasa in Disney's The Lion King onstage in Toronto for two years, as Horse in The Charlottetown Festival's production of The Full Monty in P.E.I., and starred as the lead zombie Big Daddy, in George A. Romero's long-awaited Land of the Dead. He has appeared in the films Trailer Park Boys: The Movie and Resurrecting the Champ and the TV series The L.A. Complex, Space Riders: Division Earth, The Latest Buzz, Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye, Wingin' It and The Line. He was the 2nd lead in William Shatner's made for television movie series TekWar.
