        The Colorado Festival of Horror (COFOH) 2023: Slasher Hotel annual event brings out
        all the slashers, ghouls and evil monsters on September 15-17. COFOH is the original,
        locally-owned, and fan-run convention, an intimate fan experience, creative incubator,
        and convention for all things horror. Our first Special Guest announcement is 1980s
        Scream Queen Michelle Bauer (“Nightmare Sisters”, “Sorority Babes in the Slimeball
        Bowl-O-Rama”) in her FIRST-EVER Colorado convention appearance!
        <br />
        <br />
        Michelle Bauer was born and raised in Simi Valley, California. After an audition for
        director Fred Olen Ray, she began her horror feature film career with “The Tomb”, it
        would be the first of many. Michelle became one of the most prominent scream queens
        of the 1980s slasher films. She has been featured in “Evil Toons”, “Sorority Babes in
        the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama”, “Nightmare Sisters”, “Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers” and
        many more. She has over 160 IMDb credits. Her life and career are one of the main
        subjects of the 2011 documentary “Screaming in High Heels: The Rise and Fall of the
        Scream Queen Era”. She returned for the 2020 follow-up “Screaming in High Heels:
        The Reunion” which reunited her with fellow actors and subjects Brinke Stevens and
        Linnea Quigley. Colorado Festival of Horror is excited to bring Michelle Bauer to
        Denver!
        <br />
        <br />
        COFOH will host a variety of thrilling experiences and events throughout the weekend.
        The Death Dealers Room holds a menagerie of artists, authors, vendors, and horror
        comic book creators. Delightfully fiendish horror actors sell autographs, selfies, and
        merchandise, and participate in Q&amp;As and film screenings. Wickedly good panels,
        workshops, and interactive audience events are all weekend long. This Dead Man’s
        Party is where it’s at!

        Colorado Festival of Horror is chilled to announce the return of the Rocky Mountain Paranormal Research Society! Bryan Bonner & Bob Lewis are bringing lots of spooky programming to this year's con plus the return of Jigsaw's Horror Trivia and a LIVE podcast with a COFOH Special Guest! You can also find them in the Death Dealers Room.

        For more than two decades, Rocky Mountain Paranormal has proudly been Colorado’s only forensic paranormal research society, with equal emphases on diligent investigations of paranormal claims and education and outreach programs aimed toward using the framework of paranormal claims to teach as much as possible about science and history. Everyone loves a good ghost story, right?
         
        Bryan Bonner has examined a wide range of reported paranormal phenomena, including ghosts, poltergeists, psychics, UFOs, conspiracy theories, urban legends, and much more. Unlike others in the field, Bryan has made sure not to run around cemeteries, screaming and scaring the group with over‐active imaginations. From the field to the lab, he tests bizarre beliefs and practices, conducts experiments and on‐site investigations, and recreates unusual events.
         
        Bob Lewis has an eclectic and interdisciplinary background, an obsession with the weird, an overactive sense of curiosity. He holds degrees in Biology, English, Mathematics, and Psychology (and if that weren’t enough, also took a minor in Astrophysics and then returned to grad school for more) and has a background in interdisciplinary study and research that lends itself well to investigations of unknown or unusual phenomena. Furthermore, he has professional experience in writing and publishing, magic and mentalism, and education.

        Colorado Festival of Horror and sponsors Angela Joseph & Alien Donut Films are excited to 
        announce actor Sheri Davis is coming to our September convention! Sheri will be meeting fans 
        and signing autographs at the Angela Joseph Productions table in the Outworld Bar area.


        Sheri Davis, actress/producer/director, was born and raised in a small town in Texas. She grew 
        up riding horses and motorcycles. Always a fierce competitor, she was an athlete and honor roll 
        student in high school and earned degrees in psychology and nursing in college. When she began acting, 
        many filmmakers discovered that her talents were being underutilized. Sheri was asked to help produce, 
        cast, and pull together entire films. She's worked on productions as assistant director, script 
        supervisor and production manager. Armed with her knowledge of filmmaking, from the seed of an 
        idea through distribution, Sheri directed her first short film in 2017 titled, Hair of the Dog, 
        which won several awards. She just completed directing the comedic short film 970 Square Feet. 
        Next, Sheri is starting pre-production on Amber Alert which will be the first installment to her anthology.
         

        Sheri has also made a name for herself in the independent film world, as a very versatile 
        actor who is not afraid to take on any role, as evidenced by her role as Karma Blake in the 
        award-winning, and controversial short film Snake With A Human Tail, which earned her the title 
        of a "Scream Queen" and established a horror genre fan base. Sheri can be seen in other movies 
        such as Blind, Fall of Grace, Till Death, Lake of Shadows, Vengeance Girl, Violence on Demand, 
        Bearry, Cold Blooded Killers, It Wants Blood!, the Alien Danger! film series and the short film, 
        The Lightning Man. Sheri has also received Best Actress Nominations and won 2 Best Actress Awards.

        Sheri's credits: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5560956/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1
         

        Special thank-you to Angela Joseph Productions and Alien Donut Films for sponsoring Sheri’s appearance!

        The Enigma is a legendary performer particularly at music festivals and tattoo conventions. His show is based on circus and tattoo culture which defines pop culture today. Cultivating audiences for over 20 years around the globe, The Enigma has literally changed the face of live entertainment.
        <br />
        <br />
        A founding member of Jim Rose Circus, The Enigma has toured the world many times over performing at festivals, theaters, and rock venues. i.e. Nine Inch Nails tour of the US, highest grossing show at Edinburgh Fringe Festival two years in a row, opening for David Bowie, etc. Making his Prime Time television debut on the The X Files in 1995, The Enigma has been on many talk shows and breakfast news shows around the world. "Ripley's Believe It Or Not!" and Guinness World Records have also carried his image.
        <br />
        <br />
        Coming from a background of classical piano and stage magic, The Enigma's live show includes the best possible traditional stunts. Being an innovator of the bizarre, The Enigma also produces stunts none have ever seen. All of the original music backing the show and the odd humor allow audiences to breathe and adds to The Enigma as an identifiable character. The Enigma has been on the cover of many tattoo magazines, setting the example for extreme body modification. Featured twice in National Geographic magazine, 1995 and 2004, The Enigma gets hard news stories about his shows published in advance of his debuts. The Enigma has not stopped covering new ground, breaking into the comic book arena as well as monster truck rallies and school anti-bully lectures.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you think of extreme, wild, out of this world entertainers, The Enigma stands out as the leader of his art form. He is an historic legend in body modification, circus sideshow, and tattooing, and leads the pack in that “do it yourself” renaissance style. As a refined talent of over 20 years in the business you can see that he continues to amaze and inspire. The Enigma's cult status and huge following will grow organically over the years as he constantly gives to the art world.

G. Larry Butler is one of the few actors to work in every phase of the show business industry on a continuous basis: Feature Film, Television, Internet, Radio, Theater, and Concert Hall. He began his film career with the feature film The Women’s Club in 1985. Since then he has been involved in more than 200 projects. Larry has dabbled in almost every aspect of show business, such as Vaudeville, TV news reporter, voice over artist for Japanese animation, audio book narrator, international print character model and commercial artist, concert pianist, award-winning published poet, and host of several TV shows. His most significant was Underground Hollywood in which he simultaneously hosted a radio show and a TV show, interviewing unknown artists of all types: Singers, Musicians, Actors, Authors, etc., shot in an actual cave. Acting for TV and film, his roots are in comedy, but he has crossed over to all other genres as well, most notably horror. He starred as Dr. Lazarof in the international hit Frankenstein vs the Creature from Blood Cove (an homage to the 1930s and 40s classic monster films, which won the grand prize at the World Horror Fest in 2006), and again as Professor Hunter in the very popular PanMan, a comedy horror feature film. Recently he has costarring roles in the horror films Its Just A Game, Hollywood Werewolf, Journey to Hell, Clown Motel 2, the suspense/mystery thriller, The Deceased Won’t Desist, the mystery drama Fortune Defies Death, and the drama P.T.S.D. He also plays piano professionally, providing musical accompaniment for Frank Sinatra Jr. in 2 episodes of The Defenders. He can be seen on the hit internet horror/comedy show The Vamps Next Door as Fred Peepers. He was awarded a top prize by the legendary Vincent Price for his poem “Here Lies Madness,” and later published a book by that name. Presently, Mr. Butler and his daughter Bonnie host a Movie Review called “Little Stinkers,” on YouTube, in which they critique movies for young children. They also do a Vaudeville Song and Comedy Act in several venues in Los Angeles and on the internet.

        We at Colorado Festival of Horror: Funhouse love a good slasher! So we’re excited to announce 2 SPECIAL GUESTS Sarah French & Joe Knetter and a special DOUBLE-FEATURE slasher event Friday evening, Sept 9th starting at 7pm! Two films that feature a mask, creepier than the infamous Michael Myers’ one!  You’ll meet the man behind the mask in-person, too, Jed Rowen.
<br />
<br />
7-9pm 2019’s “Blind”
<br />
<br />
9-11pm 2021’s “Pretty Boy” ** COLORADO PREMIERE **
<br />
<br />
And the claw on this hammer, so to speak, are in-person Special Guests actor Sarah French and writer Joe Knetter! They will introduce the films and do a Q&A.
<br />
<br />
Sarah French is an actress that has worked on a number of feature films, TV shows and music videos. Her horror/sci-fi credits include Blind, Pretty Boy, Space Hunters: The Battle for Deepstar, Death Count and The Special. She is an avid hiker and cross trains regularly. Her mantra is: "If I'm not working on a project, I'm working on myself."
<br />

From a young age, Joe Knetter immersed himself in the horror genre, loving the feeling of being scared and creeped out. Lucky for him, the 80s were a powerhouse time for horror films with the advent of the home video market. He watched everything he could get his hands on, taking in the craft of proper storytelling. What Joe took from it was the feeling of making an impact and affecting people, something he's aimed to do with films like Blind, Pretty Boy, and Space Hunters: The Battle for Deepstar. He was also one of the writer's picked to finish George A. Romero's last zombie epic Twilight of the Dead.

        Colorado Festival of Horror is thrilled to announce director/producer/actor Lloyd Kaufman, co-founder of Troma Entertainment, is coming to our September 2022 convention! Lloyd will be meeting fans, signing autographs and doing professional photo ops.
<br />
<br />
In the late 1960s, Kaufman was enrolled at Yale University (where he would later present his Make Your Own Damn Movie Master Classes), diligently working on a respectable degree in Chinese Studies. However, Kaufman was destined for other things. As he explains in his hit book “All I Need To Know About Filmmaking I Learned From The Toxic Avenger” (published by Penguin Putnam, and first of his seven books), "At Yale, I was placed in a dormitory room with two film fanatics, and I knew everything had irrevocably changed." In fact, Kaufman was infected with a love of movies from which he never recovered. In 1971, Kaufman met his future partner Michael Herz at Yale. The Troma Universe was born in 1974 with a series of highly original, raunchy comedies such as Squeeze Play!, Stuck On You!, Waitress!, and other titles ending with an exclamation point. These movies, independent precursors to such later smash hits as National Lampoon's Animal House and Porky's, did well financially, although Kaufman continued to work on such outside productions as Rocky and Saturday Night Fever. Kaufman's relationship with mainstream Hollywood would not last long "There were problems," Kaufman said "I always wanted to do things my own way, and my employers insisted I do things the correct way." He continued to build up a list of impressive credits as well as some overpowering debts.
<br />
<br />
Kaufman proved his former employers wrong with his 1984 breakthrough movie, The Toxic Avenger. This tale of a health club mop boy named Melvin who is transformed into a hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength struck a chord with audiences and critics alike, demonstrating that a large number of people were interested in seeing things done Kaufman's way. The Toxic Avenger led to an animated television series, Toxic Crusaders, action figures, different Marvel comic book titles, a hot sauce, etc. There were three sequels. The most recent film in the series is Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger Part IV. Currently, The Toxic Avenger is being developed by Legendary Entertainment and their team as a big-budget Hollywood remake with Peter Dinklage, Elijah Wood and Kevin Bacon. Toxic Avenger The Musical is playing in London’s West End, with music by Bon Jovi’s David Bryan.
<br />
<br />
The success of The Toxic Avenger was followed by a string of commercial and artistic triumphs in a similar vein, blending fantasy, heavy action, comedy, and eroticism in a style that can only be described as "Tromatic". These films, including the Class of Nuke ‘Em High trilogy, Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, and Troma's War, were often ignored or scorned by the intelligentsia of the time but spoke to an entire generation of young people who rejected the pandering, commercial films of the mid-to-late 80's. Some of these Troma fans went on to become filmmakers themselves, including Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith, Mike Judge, Peter Jackson, and Trey Parker. Thanks to these admirers, Kaufman has been asked to make cameo appearances in films like James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Sharknado 4, Trey Parker's Orgazmo, Eli Roth's Cabin Fever, and about 200 other indie movies.

        Colorado Festival of Horror is thrilled to announce actor Eugene Clark,
        “Big Daddy” himself from George A. Romero’s “Land of the Dead” coming to
        our September 2022 convention! Eugene will be meeting fans, signing
        autographs and doing professional photo ops wearing the overalls and
        creepy contact lenses of “Big Daddy”! Eugene Clark brings a career in
        theater, television and film that is fascinating and diverse. A veteran
        of more than 100 television productions and 15 feature films, he won a
        Gemini Award (Canadian Emmy) for Best Supporting Actor in a Dramatic
        Series for his work on the hit TV series Night Heat. He starred as
        Mufasa in Disney's The Lion King onstage in Toronto for two years, as
        Horse in The Charlottetown Festival's production of The Full Monty in
        P.E.I., and starred as the lead zombie Big Daddy, in George A. Romero's
        long-awaited Land of the Dead. He has appeared in the films Trailer Park
        Boys: The Movie and Resurrecting the Champ and the TV series The L.A.
        Complex, Space Riders: Division Earth, The Latest Buzz, Sue Thomas:
        F.B.Eye, Wingin' It and The Line. He was the 2nd lead in William
        Shatner's made for television movie series TekWar. He received critical
        acclaim for his performance as a suicidal Vietnam veteran who lost his
        arm to Agent Orange in Unnatural Causes, the Emmy Award-winning drama
        starring John Ritter and Alfre Woodard. Acting is just one of Clark's
        creative outlets. Singing has long been a love in his life. From the
        days of singing as a child in his grandfather's church, to singing the
        national anthem in uniform as a member of the Toronto Argonauts, singing
        has always been "like breath itself," he says. Distressed by television
        coverage of Africa's young famine victims, Clark wrote the lyrics,
        melody, and chorus to “Letter from a Concerned Citizen (Starvation in
        Africa)”. The Canadian Red Cross used the song for their national
        television and radio campaign to raise funds for their relief efforts in
        Africa. Of his three CDs he says, "They speak to the need for effective
        community and global co-operation, how through assisting each other in
        times of need we can accomplish anything. These songs motivate and
        encourage us to be our best, for there is greatness in all of us.”
