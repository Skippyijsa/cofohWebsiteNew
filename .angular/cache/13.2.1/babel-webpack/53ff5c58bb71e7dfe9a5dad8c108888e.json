He holds degrees in Biology, English, Mathematics, and Psychology (and if that weren\\u2019t enough, also took a minor in Astrophysics and then returned to grad school for more) and has a background in interdisciplinary study and research that lends itself well to investigations of unknown or unusual phenomena.

Sheri will be meeting fans and signing autographs at the Angela Joseph Productions table in the Outworld Bar area. Sheri Davis, actress/producer/director, was born and raised in a small town in Texas. She grew up riding horses and motorcycles. Always a fierce competitor, she was an athlete and honor roll student in high school and earned degrees in psychology and nursing in college. When she began acting, many filmmakers discovered that her talents were being underutilized. Sheri was asked to help produce, cast, and pull together entire films. She's worked on productions as assistant director, script supervisor and production manager. Armed with her knowledge of filmmaking, from the seed of an idea through distribution, Sheri directed her first short film in 2017 titled, Hair of the Dog, which won several awards. She just completed directing the comedic short film 970 Square Feet. Next, Sheri is starting pre-production on Amber Alert which will be the first installment to her anthology. Sheri has also made a name for herself in the independent film world, as a very versatile actor who is not afraid to take on any role, as evidenced by her role as Karma Blake in the award-winning, and controversial short film Snake With A Human Tail, which earned her the title of a \\\"Scream Queen\\\" and established a horror genre fan base. Sheri can be seen in other movies such as Blind, Fall of Grace, Till Death, Lake of Shadows, Vengeance Girl, Violence on Demand, Bearry, Cold Blooded Killers, It Wants Blood!, the Alien Danger! film series and the short film, The Lightning Man. Sheri has also received Best Actress Nominations and won 2 Best Actress Awards.

Larry Butler is one of the few actors to work in every phase of the show business industry on a continuous basis: Feature Film, Television, Internet, Radio, Theater, and Concert Hall. He began his film career with the feature film The Women\\u2019s Club in 1985. Since then he has been involved in more than 200 projects. Larry has dabbled in almost every aspect of show business, such as Vaudeville, TV news reporter, voice over artist for Japanese animation, audio book narrator, international print character model and commercial artist, concert pianist, award-winning published poet, and host of several TV shows. His most significant was Underground Hollywood in which he simultaneously hosted a radio show and a TV show, interviewing unknown artists of all types: Singers, Musicians, Actors, Authors, etc., shot in an actual cave. Acting for TV and film, his roots are in comedy, but he has crossed over to all other genres as well, most notably horror. He starred as Dr. Lazarof in the international hit Frankenstein vs the Creature from Blood Cove (an homage to the 1930s and 40s classic monster films, which won the grand prize at the World Horror Fest in 2006), and again as Professor Hunter in the very popular PanMan, a comedy horror feature film. Recently he has costarring roles in the horror films Its Just A Game, Hollywood Werewolf, Journey to Hell, Clown Motel 2, the suspense/mystery thriller, The Deceased Won\\u2019t Desist, the mystery drama Fortune Defies Death, and the drama P.T.S.D. He also plays piano professionally, providing musical accompaniment for Frank Sinatra Jr. in 2 episodes of The Defenders. He can be seen on the hit internet horror/comedy show The Vamps Next Door as Fred Peepers. He was awarded a top prize by the legendary Vincent Price for his poem \\u201CHere Lies Madness,\\u201D and later published a book by that name. Presently, Mr. Butler and his daughter Bonnie host a Movie Review called \\u201CLittle Stinkers,\\u201D on YouTube, in which they critique movies for young children. They also do a Vaudeville Song and Comedy Act in several venues in Los Angeles and on the internet. \");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(134, \"div\", 14);\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(135, \"div\", 15);\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(136, \"div\", 16);\n        i0.ɵɵelement(137, \"img\", 17);\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(138, \"div\", 18);\n        i0.ɵɵelement(139, \"p\");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(140, \"div\", 9);\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(141, \"mat-card\", 10);\n        i0.ɵɵelement(142, \"img\", 30);\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(143, \"mat-card-content\");\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(144, \"p\", 12);\n        i0.ɵɵtext(145, \" We at Colorado Festival of Horror: Funhouse love a good slasher!
