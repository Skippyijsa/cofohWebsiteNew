Larry Butler is one of the few actors to work in every phase of the show business industry on a continuous basis: Feature Film, Television, Internet, Radio, Theater, and Concert Hall. He began his film career with the feature film The Women\\u2019s Club in 1985. Since then he has been involved in more than 200 projects. Larry has dabbled in almost every aspect of show business, such as Vaudeville, TV news reporter, voice over artist for Japanese animation, audio book narrator, international print character model and commercial artist, concert pianist, award-winning published poet, and host of several TV shows. His most significant was Underground Hollywood in which he simultaneously hosted a radio show and a TV show, interviewing unknown artists of all types: Singers, Musicians, Actors, Authors, etc., shot in an actual cave. Acting for TV and film, his roots are in comedy, but he has crossed over to all other genres as well, most notably horror. He starred as Dr. Lazarof in the international hit Frankenstein vs the Creature from Blood Cove (an homage to the 1930s and 40s classic monster films, which won the grand prize at the World Horror Fest in 2006), and again as Professor Hunter in the very popular PanMan, a comedy horror feature film. Recently he has costarring roles in the horror films Its Just A Game, Hollywood Werewolf, Journey to Hell, Clown Motel 2, the suspense/mystery thriller, The Deceased Won\\u2019t Desist, the mystery drama Fortune Defies Death, and the drama P.T.S.D. He also plays piano professionally, providing musical accompaniment for Frank Sinatra Jr. in 2 episodes of The Defenders. He can be seen on the hit internet horror/comedy show The Vamps Next Door as Fred Peepers. He was awarded a top prize by the legendary Vincent Price for his poem \\u201CHere Lies Madness,\\u201D and later published a book by that name. Presently, Mr. Butler and his daughter Bonnie host a Movie Review called \\u201CLittle Stinkers,\\u201D on YouTube, in which they critique movies for young children.

In 1971, Kaufman met his future partner Michael Herz at Yale. The Troma Universe was born in 1974 with a series of highly original, raunchy comedies such as Squeeze Play!, Stuck On You!, Waitress!, and other titles ending with an exclamation point. These movies, independent precursors to such later smash hits as National Lampoon's Animal House and Porky's, did well financially, although Kaufman continued to work on such outside productions as Rocky and Saturday Night Fever. Kaufman's relationship with mainstream Hollywood would not last long \\\"There were problems,\\\" Kaufman said \\\"I always wanted to do things my own way, and my employers insisted I do things the correct way.\\\" He continued to build up a list of impressive credits as well as some overpowering debts.\\n\");\n        i0.ɵɵelement(154, \"br\");\n        i0.ɵɵelement(155, \"br\");\n        i0.ɵɵtext(156, \"\\nKaufman proved his former employers wrong with his 1984 breakthrough movie, The Toxic Avenger.

The Toxic Avenger led to an animated television series, Toxic Crusaders, action figures, different Marvel comic book titles, a hot sauce, etc. There were three sequels. The most recent film in the series is Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger Part IV.

He starred as Mufasa in Disney's The Lion King onstage in Toronto for two years, as Horse in The Charlottetown Festival's production of The Full Monty in P.E.I., and starred as the lead zombie Big Daddy, in George A. Romero's long-awaited Land of the Dead. He has appeared in the films Trailer Park Boys: The Movie and Resurrecting the Champ and the TV series The L.A. Complex, Space Riders: Division Earth, The Latest Buzz, Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye, Wingin' It and The Line. He was the 2nd lead in William Shatner's made for television movie series TekWar. He received critical acclaim for his performance as a suicidal Vietnam veteran who lost his arm to Agent Orange in Unnatural Causes, the Emmy Award-winning drama starring John Ritter and Alfre Woodard.

The Canadian Red Cross used the song for their national television and radio campaign to raise funds for their relief efforts in Africa.
