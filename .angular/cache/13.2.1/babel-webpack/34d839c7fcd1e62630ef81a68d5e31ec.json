Sheri Davis, actress/producer/director, was born and raised in a small town in Texas. She grew up riding horses and motorcycles. Always a fierce competitor, she was an athlete and honor roll student in high school and earned degrees in psychology and nursing in college. When she began acting, many filmmakers discovered that her talents were being underutilized. Sheri was asked to help produce, cast, and pull together entire films. She's worked on productions as assistant director, script supervisor and production manager. Armed with her knowledge of filmmaking, from the seed of an idea through distribution, Sheri directed her first short film in 2017 titled, Hair of the Dog, which won several awards. She just completed directing the comedic short film 970 Square Feet. Next, Sheri is starting pre-production on Amber Alert which will be the first installment to her anthology. Sheri has also made a name for herself in the independent film world, as a very versatile actor who is not afraid to take on any role, as evidenced by her role as Karma Blake in the award-winning, and controversial short film Snake With A Human Tail, which earned her the title of a \\\"Scream Queen\\\" and established a horror genre fan base. Sheri can be seen in other movies such as Blind, Fall of Grace, Till Death, Lake of Shadows, Vengeance Girl, Violence on Demand, Bearry, Cold Blooded Killers, It Wants Blood!, the Alien Danger! film series and the short film, The Lightning Man. Sheri has also received Best Actress Nominations and won 2 Best Actress Awards.

Larry has dabbled in almost every aspect of show business, such as Vaudeville, TV news reporter, voice over artist for Japanese animation, audio book narrator, international print character model and commercial artist, concert pianist, award-winning published poet, and host of several TV shows. His most significant was Underground Hollywood in which he simultaneously hosted a radio show and a TV show, interviewing unknown artists of all types: Singers, Musicians, Actors, Authors, etc., shot in an actual cave. Acting for TV and film, his roots are in comedy, but he has crossed over to all other genres as well, most notably horror. He starred as Dr. Lazarof in the international hit Frankenstein vs the Creature from Blood Cove (an homage to the 1930s and 40s classic monster films, which won the grand prize at the World Horror Fest in 2006), and again as Professor Hunter in the very popular PanMan, a comedy horror feature film. Recently he has costarring roles in the horror films Its Just A Game, Hollywood Werewolf, Journey to Hell, Clown Motel 2, the suspense/mystery thriller, The Deceased Won\\u2019t Desist, the mystery drama Fortune Defies Death, and the drama P.T.S.D. He also plays piano professionally, providing musical accompaniment for Frank Sinatra Jr. in 2 episodes of The Defenders. He can be seen on the hit internet horror/comedy show The Vamps Next Door as Fred Peepers. He was awarded a top prize by the legendary Vincent Price for his poem \\u201CHere Lies Madness,\\u201D and later published a book by that name. Presently, Mr. Butler and his daughter Bonnie host a Movie Review called \\u201CLittle Stinkers,\\u201D on YouTube, in which they critique movies for young children.

Romero\\u2019s \\u201CLand of the Dead\\u201D coming to our September 2022 convention! Eugene will be meeting fans, signing autographs and doing professional photo ops wearing the overalls and creepy contact lenses of \\u201CBig Daddy\\u201D! Eugene Clark brings a career in theater, television and film that is fascinating and diverse. A veteran of more than 100 television productions and 15 feature films, he won a Gemini Award (Canadian Emmy) for Best Supporting Actor in a Dramatic Series for his work on the hit TV series Night Heat. He starred as Mufasa in Disney's The Lion King onstage in Toronto for two years, as Horse in The Charlottetown Festival's production of The Full Monty in P.E.I., and starred as the lead zombie Big Daddy, in George A. Romero's long-awaited Land of the Dead. He has appeared in the films Trailer Park Boys: The Movie and Resurrecting the Champ and the TV series The L.A. Complex, Space Riders: Division Earth, The Latest Buzz, Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye, Wingin' It and The Line. He was the 2nd lead in William Shatner's made for television movie series TekWar. He received critical acclaim for his performance as a suicidal Vietnam veteran who lost his arm to Agent Orange in Unnatural Causes, the Emmy Award-winning drama starring John Ritter and Alfre Woodard. Acting is just one of Clark's creative outlets. Singing has long been a love in his life. From the days of singing as a child in his grandfather's church, to singing the national anthem in uniform as a member of the Toronto Argonauts, singing has always been \\\"like breath itself,\\\" he says. Distressed by television coverage of Africa's young famine victims, Clark wrote the lyrics, melody, and chorus to \\u201CLetter from a Concerned Citizen (Starvation in Africa)\\u201D. The Canadian Red Cross used the song for their national television and radio campaign to raise funds for their relief efforts in Africa. Of his three CDs he says, \\\"They speak to the need for effective community and global co-operation, how through assisting each other in times of need we can accomplish anything. These songs motivate and encourage us to be our best, for there is greatness in all of us.\\u201D \");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(462, \"div\", 20);\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(463, \"div\", 21);\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(464, \"div\", 22);\n        i0.ɵɵelement(465, \"img\", 23);\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(466, \"div\", 24);\n        i0.ɵɵelement(467, \"p\");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(468, \"div\", 12);\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(469, \"mat-card\", 13);\n        i0.ɵɵelement(470, \"img\", 53);\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(471, \"mat-card-content\");\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(472, \"p\", 15);\n        i0.ɵɵtext(473, \" Colorado Festival of Horror is excited to announce local artist Joe Blablazo who has created art for the festival!
